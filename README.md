## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Sass
- Mobile-first workflow
### What I learned

This project was a bit challenging, because I never worked with responsive images with the "srcset" attribute.
I also consolidated my knowledge about Sass, flexbox and the navbar structure with ul and li tags.

### Continued development

I think this project is not fully responsive: I tried to fix the tablet version making it halfway from the mobile and desktop layout, until I'll find a more optimized layout.
### Useful resources

- [Sass tutorial - Color functions](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/sass/sass-color-functions) - This helped me manipulate correctly the underline color of the links in the second section, with the lighten() function.

- [CSS Filter Generator](https://angel-rs.github.io/css-color-filter-generator/) - This helped me create a filter rule to change the color of the image logo in the footer section.
