## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Sass
- Mobile-first workflow
### What I learned

This project was a bit challenging, because I never worked with images in this way. I also consolidated my knowledge about Sass, flexbox and the navbar structure with ul and li tags.

### Continued development

This project is not fully responsive: the tablet size version isn't optimized, but I'm going to fix it when I'll understand how to make a layout that is halfway from the mobile and desktop layout.
Also, I have to find a way to make the SVG social icons white when the user hovers with the cursor.

### Useful resources

- [Sass tutorial - Color functions](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/sass/sass-color-functions) - This helped me manipulate correctly the underline color of the links in the second section, with the lighten() function.
